                <h4>ADT</h4>
                <p>ADT is short for abstract data type. It is a mathematical model for data 
                    types. And its data objects and the specification of the operations on 
                    it are independent of the storage representation of data objects and the 
                    operations on the objects.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Array</h4>
                <p>Array usually be realized as an continuous memory areas. Intuitively, 
                    array is an ordered set composed of the index and value. For each 
                    defined index, there is a related value. In mathematics, 
                    it's called of correspondence or mapping.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Linked list</h4>
                <p>Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, in which 
                    elements can be placed anywhere in memory areas.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Tree</h4>
                <p>Tree is an important data structure. Intuitively, it means when 
                    organizing data, the data are related by the form of tree branches.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Graph</h4>
                <p>Graph is composed of two sets: a finite nonempty set composed by 
                    vertex and a finite set composed by edge. Sometimes we also can 
                    use G = (V, E) to represent a graph, the V(G) and E(G) respectively 
                    represent the graph G’s vertex set and edge set.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Sortings</h4>
                <p>In computer science, arranging in an ordered sequence is called "sorting".</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Hash</h4>
                <p>Hashing is a technology, which can make query, insert and delete 
                    operations have a good expected performance. The hashing can be 
                    divided into static hashing and dynamic hashing.</p>
